I want to thank the storm
that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights
that make it glow
But I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
It barely took a breath
to realize
We’re going to be a classic
for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Sweet gingerbread made
with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe
that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Thought I was done for,
thought that love had died
But you came along,
I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it
feel like Christmas
Sweet gingerbread made
with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can’t believe
that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
I never thought
I’d find a love like this
But I found forever
in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh,
(thank you baby)
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
