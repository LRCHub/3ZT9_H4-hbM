Cozy we are
Closer than far
Sounds of forever still around

Lovers in love
Just like we were
'Cause being apart's a lonely sound

And when people ask
How we stay together
I say, you never let me down

Yeah, you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long

Look at the sun
Shining on me
Nowhere could be a better place

Lovers in love
Yeah, that's what we'll be
When you're here with me it's Christmas day

'Cause you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long
That's how you know that it's true babe

Just look at us now
Part of it all
In spite of it all we're still around

So wake up the kids
And put on some tea
Let's light up the tree it's Christmas day

And you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
Say it now, I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long

Yes, you know I do babe
All year long
