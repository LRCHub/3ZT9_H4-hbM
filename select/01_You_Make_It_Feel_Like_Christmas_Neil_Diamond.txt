Look at us now
Part of it all
In spite of it all, we're still around

Lovers in love
Just like we were
Being apart's a lonely sound

When people ask how
We stayed together
I say you never let me down

And you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long
Yes, you know that I do

Look at the sun
Shining on me
Nowhere could be a better place

Lovers in love, yeah
That's what we are
I reach for that star out there in space

'Cause you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long
And you know that it's true

Sleepy we are
But happy together
Sounds of forever, greet the day

So, wake up the kids
Put on some tea
Light up the tree, it's Christmas day

Yeah, you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long
Yes, you know that I do

All year long
Light up the tree, it's Christmas time
