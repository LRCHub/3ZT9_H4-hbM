[00:02.29] (Ooh, ooh)
[00:05.56] I wanna thank the storm that brought the snow
[00:10.66] And thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
[00:15.80] But I wanna thank you, baby
[00:18.49] You make it feel like Christmas
[00:26.28] It barely took a breath to realize
[00:31.36] We're gonna be a classic for all time
[00:36.55] I wanna thank you, baby
[00:39.14] You make it feel like Christmas
[00:45.49] Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
[00:48.47] My heart skipped and I reacted
[00:51.03] Can't believe that this is happening
[00:53.59] Like a present sent from God
[00:56.19] Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
[00:58.70] Stars are shining on us too
[01:01.06] I wanna thank you, baby
[01:04.93] You make it feel like Christmas
[01:12.66] Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
[01:17.79] But you came along, I swear you saved my life
[01:22.96] And I wanna thank you, baby
[01:25.51] 'Cause you make it feel like Christmas
[01:31.91] Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
[01:34.97] My heart skipped and I reacted
[01:37.57] Can't believe that this is happening
[01:40.04] Like a present sent from God
[01:42.67] Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
[01:45.19] Stars are shining on us, too
[01:47.47] I wanna thank you, baby
[01:51.41] You make it feel like Christmas
[01:59.11] I never thought I'd find a love like this
[02:04.19] But I found forever in that very first kiss
[02:09.32] I wanna thank you, baby
[02:11.99] You make it feel like Christmas
[02:16.62] Oh (oh, thank you, baby)
[02:19.78] I wanna thank you, baby
[02:22.31] You make it feel like Christmas
